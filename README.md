# TimeSeriesDataAnalysis
 This application will seperate a data file into many data files as described by an event file. The application should create a new data file for each event in the event list file. The new data files should contain all lines of the original data file for which the time in the data file is within the bounds of the event. The data file, event file, and output directory are to be selected by the user. Data files and event files will be deployed by the provided python script.
